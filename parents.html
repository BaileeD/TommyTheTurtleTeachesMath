<p>Welcome to the parents section of this site. Here you will learn what this site is about and how you can
help your children succeed in mathematics. A good tip is to make sure your child can count on their fingers.
If they can count it will make it a lot easier on them and you. Learning to count is easy.
You can associate it with many items including:

<ul>
<li>Different lollies</li>
<li>Different animals</li>
<li>Different colours</li>
<li>Different modes of transportations</li>
<li>Different foods etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These items can also be used to help your child learn mathematics. With the use of pictures or the item itself you
can help your child add and subtract numbers from 1 to 10. Try giving them a plate and place 2 lollies on it.
Then from your plate of lollies you take 3 and place it on their plate. Thus implying 2+3. Before they can eat any 
make them add the numbers together to get 5 and give them one as a reward. Try and get them to then figure out how
many are left once they have eaten one.
